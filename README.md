# Fire Emblem Combat Sim

A simple web app that simulates the combat from the Fire Emblem video game series. This was made as my Promineo Tech assignment for week 5 of the course. Thus it's UI is entirely through browser prompts and has no HTML. 

The app lets the user view both the player and enemy team, as well as delete and add new units. The math for the simulated battles is slightly simplified from how it is in real Fire Emblem games, but it follows the same general principles. Hit rates and critical rates have also been altered to provide a more frequently dynamic battle.

Ultimately it lacks the depth of the grid based strategy of the real thing, but in terms of the code's logic, I'm still pretty proud of it.
